_v0.1.0 Screenshot. AppPorter has changed a lot since this version_

AppPorter is a desktop application designed to simplify the installation and management of portable software (ZIP-packaged applications).

With its browser extension ([AppPorter Ext](https://github.com/AppPorter/AppPorter-Ext)) integration, users can install apps directly from their web browser and subscribe to the links of them for later use.

The app is built with Tauri, Rust, Vue 3, Tailwind CSS, and PrimeVue.
